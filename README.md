# TecHack's Intro to React Workshop To-Do List Project
- Simple to-do list that renders in the browser

## What We Did
- Deleted unnecessary/unwanted files
- Changed App.js and App.css with our own code
- Changed the title in index.html

## How to Use This Repo
- Cloning it (git clone https://github.com/natalieramirez22/TecHacks-ToDo-App-React.git) in your terminal will put the code in your editor, but it cannot be run because it is missing the node_modules folder, it is too big to include in this repo.
- Instead, create your own react app by following along with the slides from the workshop or with React's own tutorial and copy the code from the files we worked in! 

## How to Further This Project
- Play with the styling! Make it look pretty with CSS (basic CSS already in project to demonstrate how to use/link it)
- Add an edit button - Similar to the delete button, add an edit one to be able to edit the text in the input then being able to save and edit the task.
- The sky's the limit: Make it as unique and cool as you want!
